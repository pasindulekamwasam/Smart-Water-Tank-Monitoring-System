## ⚙️ How It Works

### System Operation Logic
#### 🚰 Smart Pump Control with Hysteresis
**Pump ON Conditions:**
- Water level drops below **4 cm** (pumpOnLevel)
- System automatically activates relay and pump

**Pump OFF Conditions:**
- Water level reaches **8 cm or above** (pumpOffLevel) - prevents oscillation
- **OR** No water flow detected for 3 consecutive checks after 10-second grace period
- **OR** System detects dry-run condition

#### 🛡️ Advanced Safety Features
**Dry-Run Protection Logic:**
1. **Grace Period:** 10-second startup time before flow monitoring begins
2. **Flow Monitoring:** Checks flow rate every second after grace period
3. **No-Flow Counter:** Tracks consecutive zero-flow detections
4. **Safety Shutdown:** Pump stops after 3 consecutive no-flow readings

**Hysteresis Control:**
- Prevents pump oscillation with 4cm gap between ON (4cm) and OFF (8cm) levels
- Ensures stable operation and reduces motor wear

#### 💧 Enhanced Water Quality Assessment
**TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) Analysis:**
- **Voltage Calculation:** `voltage = (sensorValue/4095.0) * 3.3`
- **TDS Formula:** `tdsValue = (133.42 * voltage³ - 255.86 * voltage² + 857.39 * voltage) * 0.5`
- **Quality Categories:**
  - ≤ 50 ppm: "Too pure"
  - ≤ 150 ppm: "Excellent" 
  - ≤ 300 ppm: "Good"
  - ≤ 500 ppm: "Acceptable"
  - ≤ 1000 ppm: "Poor"
  - \> 1000 ppm: "Unsafe"

**Turbidity Measurement:**
- **Linear approximation:** `NTU = (voltage - 2.5) * -1000.0`
- **Range:** 0-200 NTU (higher values indicate cloudier water)

**Final Water Quality Decision:**
- **🟢 "Good for Drink":** TDS ≤ 500 ppm **AND** Turbidity ≤ 200 NTU
- **🔴 "Not Good for Drink":** Either parameter exceeds threshold

#### 📊 Real-Time Monitoring System
**Flow Rate Calculation:**
- **Interrupt-driven:** Hardware interrupt on GPIO 32 for accurate pulse counting
- **Formula:** `flowRate = pulseCount / 7.5` (L/min)
- **Flow Count Tracking:** Total pulse count accumulation for usage monitoring
- **Calibration Factor:** 7.5 pulses per liter (YF-S201 sensor)
- **Reset Mechanism:** Pulse counter resets after each flow rate calculation

**Water Level Measurement:**
- **Ultrasonic Method:** HC-SR04 sensor measures distance to water surface
- **Calculation:** `waterLevel = waterHeight(13cm) - distance`
- **Validation:** Invalid readings filtered out (distance > tank height)

### Multi-Page LCD Display System
**Rotating Information Display (3-second intervals):**

**Page 1 - Level & Flow:**
```
Level: XX cm
Flow: X.X L/m
```

**Page 2 - Water Quality:**
```

```

**Page 3 - Status & System Info:**
